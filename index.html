                    <h2>The Trickster's Toolbox: Visual Deception in Sagmeister’s Designs</h2>
                    <p>Stefan Sagmeister used various materials to trick people including human bodies, food and organic materials, everyday objects, nature and the environment and handcrafted techniques.</p>
                    <p>One material used by Sagmeister to create illusions was green acetate which he used to hide, reveal and show certain parts of his works which he used for books and album covers.</p>
                    <p>One example of this was his book ‘Made you look’ which with the red acetate casing the book cover shows a happy red dog which once this casing is removed the design transforms into a red and green dog barking. Sagmeister also cleverly designed the books fore edge to when you look at it from a certain angle you can read ‘Made you look’.</p>

                    <h2>Beyond the Canvas</h2>
                    <p>Stefan Sagmeister rarely used a traditional canvas  which Sagmeister was better known for using the human body for a canvas. One of Sagmesisters most popular works is a poster for which was used for a lecture at Cranbrook college titled ‘AIGA Detroit Poster’ in 1999, Sagmesister intern carved text onto his own torso with an X-Acto knife.</p>
                    <p>This design was very controversial for the process itself as the image is seen to glorify self harm and how it visually conveys the pain. This work was seen as shocking and a unconventional design. The poster aimed to embody his belief that design ought to provoke emotional reactions, even if such reactions involve a degree of discomfort.</p>

                    <h2>Interactivity as Engagement</h2>
                    <p>Stefan Sagmeister created numerous interactive installations and designs to engage with his audience and require participation to fully complete the experience.
                    </p>
                    <p>In 2012 Sagmesiter opened an exhibition called ‘The Happy Show’ which was a traveling exhibition which visitors could interact with the exhibition such as pushing buttons or pulling levers to change visuals and reveal hidden messages. One of the interactive elements was a bike which is linked up to lights which Sagmesiter cleverly designed the shape of the lights so it could tell different messages to his audience as they used the bike.</p>
                    <p>Going back to visual deception Sagmesiter designed a staircase which on the way up it reads ‘Don't Expect’ and then on the way down it reads ‘People to Change’ which could trick people to think they are exiting the exhibition a different way.</p>
